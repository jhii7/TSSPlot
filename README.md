# TSSPlot
Example composite plot of the distribution of read counts around transcriptional start sites.

Data contains four transcription factors, known as "Yamanaka factors" (Oct4/Pou5f1, Sox2, cMYc, and Klf4). These TFs, when applied to adult cells, induces pluripotency. Two histone modifications, H3K4me2 and H3K27ac (two HMs which are often associated with the expression of Yamanaka factors in mouse embryonic stem cells), are also included in the data.

This code was made as part of UCSD's CSE 185 SP24 class taught by Melissa Gymrek. 

From the lab report:
1. Aligning ChIP-seq reads to a reference genome
2. Visualizing ChIP-seq data in IGV.
3. Identifying binding sites from ChIP-seq data ("peak calling")

**4. Visualizing patterns of transcription factor and histone modification binding. <-- We are here.**


5. Motif finding to identify the sequence a transcription factor binds to.
